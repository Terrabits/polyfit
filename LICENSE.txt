// * This code is used to fit a series of n points with a polynomial  *
// * of degree k, and calculation of error bars on the coefficients.  *
// * If error is provided on the y values, it is possible to use a    *
// * weighted fit as an option. Another option provided is to fix the *
// * intercept value, i.e. the first parameter.                       *
// *                                                                  *
// * This code has been written partially using data from publicly    *
// * available sources.                                               *
// *                                                                  *
// * The code works to the best of the author's knowledge, but some   *
// * bugs may be present. This code is provided as-is, with no        *
